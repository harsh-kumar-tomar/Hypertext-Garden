# 1865
**johnson line** (india follow this line)
- Drawn by British officer W.H. Johnson in 1865.
- It placed Aksai Chin within the princely state of Jammu & Kashmirâ€”thus, under British India.
- India adopted this line after independence, which is why India claims Aksai Chin as its own territory.
- But China never officially accepted this line.

# 1890
**mccartney macdonald line** (china follows this line )
- Proposed by British in the 1890s (a more southern line).
- This gave Aksai Chin to China to avoid friction with the Qing Empire.
- China prefers this version, which matches where its G219 road is.
# 1914
mcmahon line (india follows this line)
- Drawn in 1914 during the Simla Convention between:
    - British India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³
    - Tibet ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡© (then acting as an independent state)
- The line was negotiated by British official Sir Henry McMahon.
- It placed the entire area of Arunachal Pradesh (then called the North-East Frontier Agency, or NEFA) within India.

china's point on mcmahon line 
- China does not accept the McMahon Line, because:
    - It says Tibet had no independent authority to sign international treaties in 1914.
    - So, any agreement made by Tibet is invalid in Chinaâ€™s eyes.
- As a result, China claims ~90,000 sq. km of territory in Arunachal Pradesh as part of its South Tibet.
