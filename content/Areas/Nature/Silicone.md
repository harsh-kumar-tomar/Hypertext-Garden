## What
Silicone is not plastic and not natural rubber.  
It’s a synthetic polymer made of silicon (Si), oxygen (O), carbon, and hydrogen atoms.

Base unit = siloxane chain -> –Si–O–Si–O– backbone (like flexible glass)  

Silicon ≠ Silicone  
Silicon = element (from sand)  
Silicone = polymer derived from silicon

Silicone that has been purified + manufactured to meet safety standards for direct contact with food and beverages .
## Uses
- Very heat-resistant, flexible, chemically inert  
- Feels rubbery but doesn’t degrade like plastic
- heat resistant -40 - 230 .C
- non reactive
- odorless , tasteless
- easy

## History

- invented in 1930 in US as it is used in military .
- used in 1980 in europe as kitcheware .
