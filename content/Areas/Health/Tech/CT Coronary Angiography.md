## Goal
We want to take clear pictures of the heart’s blood pipes (coronary arteries) to see if there are any blockages or narrowing (which can cause chest pain or heart attack).

## Step 1
- Fasting: No food for 4-6 hours before the test.
- Beta-blocker (like Metoprolol) may be given to slow the heart rate.
- Nitroglycerin (a medicine) given to widen arteries.
- Kidney function check (blood test) to ensure kidneys can handle contrast.

## Step 2
- Lie down on the scanner table with your arms raised.
- ECG leads (small stickers on chest) attached to monitor your heart’s rhythm.
- IV needle inserted in your arm for injecting the dye.

## Step 3
- Contrast dye (iodine-based) injected through the IV into the bloodstream.
- This dye helps make the heart arteries visible.
- After dye injection, a saline flush (salt water) is given to help move the dye through.
Feelings: May feel a warm sensation or a metallic taste — this is normal.


## Step 4
- The CT scanner takes X-ray images of the heart arteries.
- The scanner is donut-shaped, and the table slides into the hole.
- You will need to hold your breath for about 5–10 seconds while the pictures are taken.
- The machine is synced with your heart's rhythm, capturing images when your heart is still (diastole).

## Step 5
- The computer creates 3D images of the heart and arteries.
- The radiologist reviews for:
    - Narrowing or blockages.
    - Plaque (fatty or calcium deposits).
    - Abnormal artery shapes.

## Step 6
- Drink plenty of water to help flush out the contrast.
- You can go home the same day.


## Conclusion
- Whether blockages are present and how severe (mild, moderate, or severe).
- Location of blockages (which artery).
- Plaque type (fatty, calcified).
- Any abnormalities (like heart artery anomalies).
