## What 

It’s made by reacting:  
- Acetone (propanone)  
- Phenol (an aromatic alcohol)

BPA +  other chemical  ->plastic polymer
BPA + Epichlorohydrin -> resin

polymer = clear , tough , heat resistant


## Uses
- it is a raw material used for making plastic (water bottle,eyeglass lenses) and resins .
- stable under high heat .
## Harm
- BPA is leached into food when heated or scratched or food is fatty or acidic .
- it distubs harmone . 
- during reaction some unracted BPA molecules are left out . 
## Status
- banned by India , USA , Japan , Canada for using in specific items like baby bottles .
## History
- 1891 , First synthesized by Russian chemist Aleksandr Dianin .
- 1930 , Tested as synthetic estrogen (it weakly mimics estrogen) — but rejected .
- 1950 , Used by Bayer and General Electric to make polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins .
