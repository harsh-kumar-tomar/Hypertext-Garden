Omega-3s are essential polyunsaturated fats that the body cannot produce on its own. There are **three main types**:

|Type|Source|Function|
|---|---|---|
|**ALA (Alpha-Linolenic Acid)**|Chia seeds, flaxseeds, walnuts|Precursor to EPA & DHA (low conversion efficiency)|
|**EPA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)**|Fish, algae|Anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular benefits|
|**DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid)**|Fish, algae|Essential for brain & eye function|

ALA (Alpha-Linolenic Acid) is not directly used by the body in its original form but is converted into EPA and DHA which are the biologically active forms. 
However, this conversion process is highly inefficient.
The body prioritizes using ALA for energy production rather than conversion.
