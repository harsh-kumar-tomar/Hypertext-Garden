## What 
 oven allows us to cook crispy, golden-fried food without using pan full of oil.

## Working
An air fryer works by circulating hot air rapidly throughout its interior. Similar to a convection oven, there’s a fan that circulates hot air around food in a perforated tray or basket. Because all the surface areas of the food are exposed to the hot air, the food cooks to become crispy on all sides without having to be submerged in hot oil.
